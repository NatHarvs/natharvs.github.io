                    I'm a hardworking programmer who enjoys a challenge. A burning desire to succeed
                    and overcome obstacles. I did my A-Levels in Maths, Physics and Computer Science
                    in order to get a strong foundation to program for games.<br /><br />


                    I first began to enjoy video games whilst playing on the Nintendo 64
                    and I then began to play on the Wii, Xbox 360, Playstation 4 in my later years.
                    When choosing my options for GCSE, Computer Science was offered as a choice subject
                    and upon choosing Computer Science I decided to combine the two things I love.
                    Programming and Games. <br /><br />

                    During my time in university I have taken part in 3 Games Jams and plan to do
                    more. The first was the Freshers Week Game Jam that Staffordshire University
                    put together during our first week at the University. My team achieved first place
                    and had a fantastic experience. My second and third Games Jam were the 2018 and 2019
                    Ukie Games Jams. These were both challenging and I loved the experience in both. </font></br>

                    Using C++ and following the simple rules of cohesion, alignment and separation made by Craig
                    Reynolds, these boids(little squares) were created to behave as a flock. Skeleton code was
                    given that had the squares already made and a few mathematical functions were provided that
                    did arithmetic on 3D vectors.

                    Reflection:<br />
                    To expand on this project a few obstacles could be added for the agents to avoid and the wall
                    clipping could be perfected so the flock travels together. Instead of using small squares to
                    convey the flocking, images of fish or birds might be better presented.

                    Upon taking part in a game jam in the first week of university, each team was instructed to
                    create a game with a theme. The theme for our team was Satan . An idea for Satan Runner was
                    formed. Player controls Satan running on top of a train and must avoid the vicar shots before
                    reaching the Pope. This was done as part of a team of 5, with my task to code the vicar.
                    The group came first place in the game jam.</font>

                    see where the water is coming from to dodge it.</font>

                        Level 2 could have been created with more game features to increase playability. The background
                        sprite sheet stretches when the player reaches close to the end. Level 1 had the possibility of
                        having the floors react to collision from beneath as such in the original game. The text font is
                        not suitable to the game and the spritesheet required offsets so a better spritesheet for text could
                        have been implemented.

                    A ton was learnt from this assignment about rendering and texturing and I was pleased with how it turned out.
                    The user interaction was limited to rotating the cubes and camera. To improve this, more functionality to the
                    scene could have been implemented to make it more interactive such as having an playable objective.</font>

                        In this A-Level Computer Science assignment, a simple 2D platformer game was made. In this game
                        a ball is controlled and must reach the end without colliding with pyramids. This was done in
                        Unity using C#. The Ball Platformer was my first game.

                        It is simple game with a large amount of documentation that was involved. The text needs to be
                        bigger to be more readable and in the top left corner. Instead of a finish point, the platforms
                        could be precedurally generated with the camera moving on its own accord to incread the replayability.
                        Special effects added to the gem when picked up would give some feedback to the player as well as
                        audio.
