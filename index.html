                <p>
                    I'm a hardworking programmer who enjoys a challenge. A burning desire to succeed
                    and overcome obstacles. I did my A-Levels in Maths, Physics and Computer Science
                    in order to get a strong foundation to program for games.<br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    I first began to enjoy video games whilst playing on the Nintendo 64
                    and I then began to play on the Wii, Xbox 360, Playstation 4 in my later years.
                    When choosing my options for GCSE, Computer Science was offered as a choice subject
                    and upon choosing Computer Science I decided to combine the two things I love.
                    Programming and Games.

                <br />
                <p>
                    Using C++ and following the simple rules of cohesion, alignment and separation made by Craig
                    Reynolds, these boids(little squares) were created to behave as a flock. Skeleton code was
                    given that had the squares already made and a few mathematical functions were provided that
                    did arithmetic on 3D vectors.

                    To expand on this project a few obstacles could be added for the agents to avoid and the wall
                    clipping could be perfected.

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Upon taking part in a game jam in the first week of university, each team was instructed to
                        create a game with a theme. The theme for our team was Satan . An idea for Satan Runner was
                        formed. Player controls Satan running on top of a train and must avoid the vicar shots before
                        reaching the Pope. This was done as part of a team of 5, with my task to code the vicar.
                        The group came first place in the game jam.

                    <p>
                        The task was to take the skeleton code of Mario Bros and make a game out of it.
                        SDL was used.

                        In order to improve on this project, level 2 could have been created with
                        more game features to increase playability. Level 1 had the possibility
                        of having the floors react to collision from beneath as such in the original
                        game.

                        One assignment that was completed at university using C++. An OBJ Loader was
                        written which read obj files and loaded them into the scene.

                        Reflection: <br />
                        For this assignment, it was not required to make a game or have the user interact
                        with the scene frequently. Although more interactive features besides the camera movement
                        and the rotation of textured cubes could have been included.

                    <p>
                        The first game made while at University was the idea of making a game similar to Pac-Man.
                        We got given the skeleton code and followed tutorials. I hope to progress further and
                        create more refined games in the future.

                        Looking back on this assignment, a lot stands out that can be improved upon. It is simple and
                        lacks replayability. I'll be using this as a reference to my progression.

                    <br />
                    <p>
                        In this A-Level Computer Science assignment, a simple 2D platformer game was made. In this game
                        a ball is controlled and must reach the end without colliding with pyramids. This was done in
                        Unity using C#. The Ball Platformer was my first game.
                        <br />

                        <br />
                        Reflection: <br />
                        It is simple game with a large amount of documentation that was involved. The text needs to be
                        bigger to be more readable and in the top left corner. Instead of a finish point, the platforms
                        could be precedurally generated with the camera moving on its own accord to incread the replayability.
                        Special effects added to the gem when picked up would give some feedback to the player as well as
                        audio.
